For seminar talks and conference contributions listed here, I include all collaborators of the presented work in alphabetical order.
Note that the slides (in handout version), posters and additional materials have not been peer reviewed.
Please find corresponding publications under the specified arXiv-IDs.

The list also includes some events where I got invited for participation or moderated/chaired sessions (gray), and where I coorganized (green).
For these, I specify the event title in bold and give the list of scientific organizers.
