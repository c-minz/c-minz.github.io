I am a researcher in mathematical and theoretical physics, mostly working on 
- causal set theory (a framework for quantum gravity),
- Tomita-Takesaki modular theory in quantum field theory, and
- algebraic framework of quantum field theory.

I received my PhD from the University of York, UK in July 2022, for which I worked on classical and quantum field theory on causal sets.
Most of my [repositories](/repositories/) contain source code developed for research projects on these topics. 

My research interests also include quantum gravity, for example, the approaches of causal set theory, causal dynamical triangulations, non-commutative geometry of spacetimes.
