I am a researcher in mathematical and theoretical physics, mostly working on 
- causal set theory (an approach to quantum gravity),
- Tomita-Takesaki modular theory in quantum field theory, and
- other aspects of quantum field theory (mostly using the algebraic framework).

I received my PhD from the University of York, UK in July 2022, for which I worked on classical and quantum field theory on causal sets.
Most of my [repositories](/repositories/) contain source code developed for research projects on these topics. 

My research interests also include quantum gravity, not only causal set theory, but also other approaches like causal dynamical triangulations, and non-commutative geometry of spacetimes. 

Please follow this link to get [more information on my projects](/projects/). 
These include the development of the [LaTeX package 'causets'](https://ctan.org/pkg/causets) and an [online editor 'PrOSET'](/assets/html/proset-editor.html).
