I am a researcher in mathematical and theoretical physics. My research work is on

- modular operators and modular Hamiltonian in quantum field theory,
- application of modular theory to relative entropy and other entanglement measures,
- quantum field theory on discrete spacetime models, like causal sets,
- mathematical properties of partially ordered sets and causal sets (and their embedding in spacetime manifolds), and
- other aspects of quantum field theory and other approaches to quantum gravity.

I received my PhD from the University of York, UK in July 2022, where I worked on problems of classical and quantum field theory on causal sets. Many of my research projects involve numerical methods. The source code of these projects and further developments are available through my [repositories](/repositories/).

You may find [information on my projects](/projects/) and a [list of my publications](/publications/).
For example, here are some quick links to tools that I developed in projects on partially ordered sets (and causal set applications):

- The [LaTeX package 'causets'](https://ctan.org/pkg/causets): draw Hasse diagrams in LaTeX documents.
- The ['PrOSET' editor](/assets/html/proset-editor.html): an online visualisation tool for partially ordered sets (posets).
