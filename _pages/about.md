I am a researcher in mathematical and theoretical physics. My research work is on 
- modular operators, modular Hamiltonian in quantum field theory, using Tomita-Takesaki theory and numerical approximation schemes,
- quantum field theory on discrete spacetime models, like causal sets, 
- mathematical aspects of partially ordered sets with applications to causal set theory (an approach to quantum gravity), and 
- other aspects, like relative entropy of states, in quantum field theory mostly using the algebraic framework.

I received my PhD from the University of York, UK in July 2022, where I worked on problems of classical and quantum field theory on causal sets. Many of my research projects involve numerical methods. The source code of these projects and further developments are available through my [repositories](/repositories/). 

You may find [information on my projects](/projects/) and a [list of my publications](/publications/). 
For example, here are some quick links to tools that I developed in projects on partially ordered sets (and causal set applications):
- The [LaTeX package 'causets'](https://ctan.org/pkg/causets): draw Hasse diagrams in LaTeX documents.
- The ['PrOSET' editor](/assets/html/proset-editor.html): an online visualisation tool for partially ordered sets (posets).
