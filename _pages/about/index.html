Most of my <a href="/repositories/">repositories</a> contain source code developed for research projects on these topics.</p> <p>My research interests also include quantum gravity, not only causal set theory, but also other approaches like causal dynamical triangulations, and non-commutative geometry of spacetimes.</p> <h2 id="causal-sets-and-hasse-diagrams">Causal sets and Hasse diagrams</h2> <p>Alongside my doctoral studies, I developed a LaTeX package to draw Hasse diagrams for causal sets. It is available through <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/causets" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CTAN</a>, so that it already comes with a full LaTeX installation (for example, it is ready to use on Overleaf). Just load the package with</p> <div class="language-tex highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">\usepackage</span><span class="p">{</span>causets<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Package features are:</p> <ul> <li>has short macros working in text and math mode</li> <li>the macro input is a permutation of consecutive integers</li> <li>generalises the idea of 2D-orders to draw generic diagrams</li> <li>uses TikZ to draw diagrams for ease of use also in larger graphics</li> <li>the online <strong>PrOSET Editor</strong> helps to generate the macro (currently working for 2D-orders): <a href="/assets/html/proset-editor.html">PrOSET Editor</a> </li> </ul> </body></html>
