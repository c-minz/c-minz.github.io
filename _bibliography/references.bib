    title = "{Local symmetries in partially ordered sets}",
    abstract = "Partially ordered sets (posets) have a universal appearance as an abstract structure in many areas of mathematics. Though, even their explicit enumeration remains unknown in general, and only the counts of all partial orders on sets of up to 16 unlabelled elements have been calculated to date, see sequence A000112 in the OEIS. In this work, we study automorphisms of posets in order to formulate a classification by local symmetries. These symmetries give rise to a division operation on the set of all posets and lead us to the construction of symmetry classes that are easier to characterise and enumerate. Additionally to the enumeration of symmetry classes, I derive polynomial expressions that count certain subsets of posets with a large number of layers (a large height). As an application in physics, I investigate local symmetries (or rather their lack of) in causal sets, which are discrete spacetime models used as a candidate framework for quantum gravity.",

    title = "{Algebraic Classical and Quantum Field Theory on Causal Sets}",
    abstract = "The framework of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory (pAQFT) is used to construct QFT models on causal sets. We discuss various discretised wave operators, including a new proposal based on the idea of a 'preferred past,' which we also introduce, and show how they may be used to construct classical free and interacting field theory models on a fixed causal set; additionally, we describe how the sensitivity of observables to changes in the background causal set may be encapsulated in a relative Cauchy evolution. These structures are used as the basis of a deformation quantization, using the methods of pAQFT. The SJ state is defined and discussed as a particular quantum state on the free quantum theory. Finally, using the framework of pAQFT, we construct interacting models for arbitrary interactions that are smooth functions of the field configurations. This is the first construction of such a wide class of models achieved in QFT on causal sets.",
