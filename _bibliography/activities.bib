    title = "{Modular Hamiltonians of the massless and massive scalar field on the half line}",
    abstract = "We study the modular Hamiltonian of the free, massive scalar field in the vacuum state over subspace regions of a (1+1)-dimensional half space with a spatial boundary subject to a Robin (mixed) boundary condition, using a recently developed numerical approach for initial data on a time-0 hypersurface (here the real half line). For the subspace region, we consider a single interval at a generic position on the half line. When the interval is adjacent to the boundary with a Neumann or Dirichlet boundary condition, we can use the known result of boundary conformal field theory to test our algorithm. We then obtain new results in presence of a Robin boundary condition (once for the massless and once for the massive regime).<br>In a second part, we move the interval subspace away from the boundary. Besides the local contribution, also non-local contributions to the modular Hamiltonian occur, which are mostly concentrated along a certain curve of conjugate points in the massless regime. For large distances to the boundary, the massless modular Hamiltonian (restricted to the subspace) approaches the Hislop-Longo double cone result. In the massive regime, the modular Hamiltonian approaches the results from a previous numerical study of the massive modular Hamiltonian of a double cone in Minkowski spacetime in the large distance limit.<br>This talk is based on work in collaboration with Erik Tonni at SISSA, Trieste.",

    abstract = {Modular theory is a tool for von Neumann algebras and for the mathematical formulation and computation of entanglement quantities in quantum field theory. Finding analytic solutions for modular operators is challenging and only very few cases --- mostly for conformal fields --- are known. After giving a brief introduction to modular operators and some literature suggestions from a perspective motivated by physics, I will introduce a numerical approximation scheme that we have developed in the last years. With this scheme, we can approximate the solutions of modular Hamiltonians for local subalgebras in flat spacetime (with/without boundaries) and linear quantum fields of (massive) scalar bosons and fermions. We tested the numerical method against known results and then apply it to subspace settings for which no analytic solutions are known. Our numerical results for double cones showed that the modular Hamiltonian indeed depends on the mass parameter (and on the boundary parameter) and is 'non-local' in most cases. These results motivated later analytic computations for fermions in the small mass regime using perturbative techniques.<br>The results are from joined projects with Henning Bostelmann, Daniela Cadamuro, Markus Fr\"ob, and Erik Tonni. First numerical results on bosons (arXiv:2209.04681) and the perturbation for fermions of small mass (arXiv:2312.04629) have been published already, while two more publications are in preparation.},

    title = "{Do causal sets have symmetries?}",
    abstract = "Causal sets are locally finite, partially ordered sets (posets), which are considered as discrete models of spacetime. On the one hand, causal sets corresponding to a spacetime manifold are commonly generated with a random process called sprinkling. This process keeps only a discrete set of points of the manifold and their causal relations (loosing the spacetime symmetries in each sprinkle). On the other hand, the main conjecture of causal set theory is that given an ensemble of causal sets there is a corresponding spacetime manifold and the continuum symmetries of it are like all manifold properties 'reconstructible' from the partial orders of all the causal sets in the ensemble. But most generic finite posets have very few layers ('instances of time') in contrast to sprinkles with many layers in a sufficently large spacetime region.<br>In a recent project, I investigated the automorphism groups of (finite) posets in order to identify and classify their symmetries systematically. The comparison of local symmetries of generic posets (including Kleitmann-Rothschild orders) with sprinkled causal sets may help us to find posets that can serve as discrete spacetime models in causal set theory.<br>In the discussion of the results, we use the representation of posets as Hasse diagrams. I developed some simple tools (available for LaTeX and online) that will be explained alongside.",

    title = "{Local Structure for the Discretization of the Scalar Field Equations on Sprinkled Causal Sets}",
    abstract = "One framework for quantum gravity is causal set theory, where the classical spacetime continuum is replaced by locally finite, partially ordered sets of events (causal sets). For the description of classical (and quantum) scalar fields on causal sets, it is necessary to find a discretization of the Klein-Gordon equation.<br>In this talk, I will review a newly proposed method for discretization that does not require the dimension of the spacetime continuum as an input, but rather relies on an additional local structure derived from the rank 2 past of causal set events, which is the set of events that are two links to the past. I will show results from our most recent publication, where we investigated this local structure --- called preferred past --- using numerical techniques, generating ensembles of causal sets from Minkowski spacetimes by the Poisson process of sprinkling. Our results give a method that performs particularly well at uniquely selecting --- with very high probability --- a preferred past satisfying desirable properties.<br>This talk is based on a publication in joint work with C. J. Fewster, E. Hawkins, and K. Rejzner.",

These diamonds play an essential role in a recently proposed discretization method for the Klein-Gordon equation on causal sets. For this discretization, we need to choose a 'preferred past' from the two link past for each causet event. We test six criteria to reduce this choice and show numerical results for the diamonds that are spanned between a causet event and its two link past as selected by the criteria.<br>This talk is based on joint work with C.

    abstract = {Localization of electromagnetic waves in random media received renewed interest in the last years. Recent ultrafast optical experiments [1] indicate the existence of highly localized photon modes in a system of homogeneous, randomly distributed, vertically aligned ZnO nano-needles. In particular, hot spots in the spatial distribution of the second harmonic generation (SHG) were found. <br> In this work, we discuss the optical near field, which we obtain from full 3D solutions of Maxwell's equations of a model system in time domain. The spatial distribution of the electric near-field and the squared electric near-field intensity are investigated with statistical methods. The results are compared to the experimental findings. <br> [1] We thank Manfred Maschek, Slawa Schmidt, Martin Silies and Christoph Lienau from the Carl von Ossietzky Universit\"at Oldenburg as well as Takashi Yatsui, Kokoro Kitamura and Motoichi Ohtsu from the University of Tokyo for sharing their experimental data with us prior to publication.},
