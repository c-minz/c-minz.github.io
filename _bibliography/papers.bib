    title = "{Algebraic Field Theory on Causal Sets: Local Structures and Quantization Methods}",
    abstract = "I investigate aspects of classical and quantum real scalar field theory on causal sets --- a discrete framework for space and time --- using the algebraic perspective. After reviewing and generalizing necessary notation, I consider different discretizations of the Klein-Gordon field equations to describe the dynamics of a scalar field. I generalize a recently proposed discretization method that uses a preferred past structure (which assigns a specific past element to every element of a causal set) to lattices in Minkowski spacetime of any dimension. With numerical techniques, I analyse criteria to assign a preferred past structure to more general causal sets that are generated via sprinkling --- a Poisson process on a given spacetime manifold. It turns out that there exists a method that is very successful in selecting a preferred past uniquely with high probability (for finite causal sets on Minkowski spacetime). I review quantization methods and algebraic states. For the case of a finite causal set, I show how to construct a symplectic vector space with an inner product. The given structure lets me apply the method of geometric quantization to determine a quantum algebra and define a state, which is the Sorkin-Johnston state --- commonly considered for quantum field theory on causal sets. Additionally, I discuss the relationship of the geometrically constructed quantum algebra to deformation quantization to motivate future applications like a non-perturbative construction of the quantum algebra for interacting field theories via geometric quantization.",

    title = "{Local Structure of Sprinkled Causal Sets}",
    abstract = "We describe numerical and analytical investigations of causal sets sprinkled into spacetime manifolds. The first part of the paper is a numerical study of finite causal sets sprinkled into Alexandrov subsets of Minkowski spacetime of dimensions 1+1, 1+2 and 1+3. In particular we consider the rank 2 past of sprinkled causet events, which is the set of events that are two links to the past. Assigning one of the rank 2 past events as “preferred past” for each event yields a 'preferred past structure,' which was recently proposed as the basis for a causal set d'Alembertian. We test six criteria for selecting rank 2 past subsets. One criterion performs particularly well at uniquely selecting --- with very high probability --- a preferred past satisfying desirable properties. The second part of the paper concerns (infinite) sprinkled causal sets for general spacetime manifolds. After reviewing the construction of the sprinkling process with the Poisson measure, we consider various specific applications. Among other things, we compute the probability of obtaining a sprinkled causal set of a given isomorphism class by combinatorial means, using a correspondence between causal sets in Alexandrov subsets of 1+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime and 2D-orders. These methods are also used to compute the expected size of the past infinity as a proportion of the total size of a sprinkled causal set.",

    title = "{Shock wave polarizations and optical metrics in the Born and the Born-Infeld electrodynamics}",
    abstract = "We analyze the behavior of shock waves in nonlinear theories of electrodynamics. For this, by use of generalized Hadamard step functions of increasing order, the electromagnetic potential is developed in a series expansion near the shock wave front. This brings about a corresponding expansion of the respective electromagnetic field equations which allows for deriving relations that determine the jump coefficients in the expansion series of the potential. We compute the components of a suitable gauge-normalized version of the jump coefficients given for a prescribed tetrad compatible with the shock front foliation. The solution of the first-order jump relations shows that, in contrast to linear Maxwell's electrodynamics, in general the propagation of shock waves in nonlinear theories is governed by optical metrics and polarization conditions describing the propagation of two differently polarized waves (leading to a possible appearance of birefringence). In detail, shock waves are analyzed in the Born and Born-Infeld theories verifying that the Born-Infeld model exhibits no birefringence and the Born model does. The obtained results are compared to those ones found in literature. New results for the polarization of the two different waves are derived for Born-type electrodynamics.",
