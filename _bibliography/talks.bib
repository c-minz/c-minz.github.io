    title = "{Mass dependence of modular operators for double cones}",
    abstract = "Tomita-Takesaki modular theory is a tool in the mathematical formulation of quantum field theory. It is applied, for example, in the computation of (relative) entropies between subsystems. However, finding analytic solutions for modular operators is challenging and only very few cases --- mostly for massless fields --- are known.<br>I will give a brief overview on modular operators and mention some papers that give a good introduction to the topic from a perspectives motivated by physics. Then I will show some results from my current numerical project. In this project, we developed a numerical approximation scheme for the modular operator of local subalgebras in linear quantum fields of massive bosons and fermions. The numerical method is tested with the known results of right wedges in 2-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. New numerical results for a double cones showed that the modular operator indeed depends on the mass parameter (against previous expectations). For small masses, we also used a perturbative technique to get first order corrections to the massless operator.<br>Further numeric results include fermions over two double cone regions, where cross-correlation effects occur that significantly change with the mass parameter.<br>The results are from a joined project with Henning Bostelmann and Daniela Cadamuro.",

There are different approaches to quantise the classical fields, of which we consider deformation quantisation and geometric quantisation over the symplectic space of the classical field data that is equipped with an inner product. For a free scalar field on a causal set, I show how to define a state associated to the corresponding quantisation map that turns out to be the Sorkin-Johnston state. The geometric construction suggests a natural generalization to less linear examples, such as interacting fields, which is subject to an ongoing project.<br>The main results are based on my PhD project with Eli Hawkins and Kasia Rejzner (arXiv:2207.05667).",

For the description of classical (and quantum) scalar fields on causal sets, it is necessary to find a discretization of the Klein-Gordon equation.<br>In this talk, I will review a newly proposed method for discretization that does not require the dimension of the spacetime continuum as an input, but rather relies on an additional local structure derived from the rank 2 past of causal set events, which is the set of events that are two links to the past. I will show results from our most recent publication, where we investigated this local structure - called preferred past - using numerical techniques, generating ensembles of causal sets from Minkowski spacetimes by the Poisson process of sprinkling. Our results give a method that performs particularly well at uniquely selecting - with very high probability - a preferred past satisfying desirable properties.<br>This talk is based on a publication in joint work with C.
