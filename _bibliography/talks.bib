    title = "{Local Structure for the Discretization of the Scalar Field Equations on Sprinkled Causal Sets}",
    abstract = "One framework for quantum gravity is causal set theory, where the classical spacetime continuum is replaced by locally finite, partially ordered sets of events (causal sets). For the description of classical (and quantum) scalar fields on causal sets, it is necessary to find a discretization of the Klein-Gordon equation.<br>In this talk, I will review a newly proposed method for discretization that does not require the dimension of the spacetime continuum as an input, but rather relies on an additional local structure derived from the rank 2 past of causal set events, which is the set of events that are two links to the past. I will show results from our most recent publication, where we investigated this local structure - called preferred past - using numerical techniques, generating ensembles of causal sets from Minkowski spacetimes by the Poisson process of sprinkling. Our results give a method that performs particularly well at uniquely selecting - with very high probability - a preferred past satisfying desirable properties.<br>This talk is based on a publication in joint work with C. J. Fewster, E. Hawkins, and K. Rejzner.",

These diamonds play an essential role in a recently proposed discretization method for the Klein-Gordon equation on causal sets. For this discretization, we need to choose a 'preferred past' from the two link past for each causet event. We test six criteria to reduce this choice and show numerical results for the diamonds that are spanned between a causet event and its two link past as selected by the criteria.<br>This talk is based on joint work with C.

    abstract = {Localization of electromagnetic waves in random media received renewed interest in the last years. Recent ultrafast optical experiments [1] indicate the existence of highly localized photon modes in a system of homogeneous, randomly distributed, vertically aligned ZnO nano-needles. In particular, hot spots in the spatial distribution of the second harmonic generation (SHG) were found. <br> In this work, we discuss the optical near field, which we obtain from full 3D solutions of Maxwell's equations of a model system in time domain. The spatial distribution of the electric near-field and the squared electric near-field intensity are investigated with statistical methods. The results are compared to the experimental findings. <br> [1] We thank Manfred Maschek, Slawa Schmidt, Martin Silies and Christoph Lienau from the Carl von Ossietzky Universit\"at Oldenburg as well as Takashi Yatsui, Kokoro Kitamura and Motoichi Ohtsu from the University of Tokyo for sharing their experimental data with us prior to publication.},
