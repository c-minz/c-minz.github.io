    title = "{Statistical properties of photon modes in random arrays of ZnO nano-needles}",
    abstract = {Localization of electromagnetic waves in random media received renewed interest in the last years. Recent ultrafast optical experiments [1] indicate the existence of highly localized photon modes in a system of homogeneous, randomly distributed, vertically aligned ZnO nano-needles. In particular, hot spots in the spatial distribution of the second harmonic generation (SHG) were found. <br> In this work, we discuss the optical near field, which we obtain from full 3D solutions of Maxwell's equations of a model system in time domain. The spatial distribution of the electric near-field and the squared electric near-field intensity are investigated with statistical methods. The results are compared to the experimental findings. <br> [1] We thank Manfred Maschek, Slawa Schmidt, Martin Silies and Christoph Lienau from the Carl von Ossietzky Universit\"at Oldenburg as well as Takashi Yatsui, Kokoro Kitamura and Motoichi Ohtsu from the University of Tokyo for sharing their experimental data with us prior to publication.},
