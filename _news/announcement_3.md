[More information on my projects](/projects/) are now available on separate pages.
The first project page includes a catalogue of the Hasse diagrams of all posets up to cardinality 7 as supplemental material to my recent preprint, [Local symmetries in partially ordered sets](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2406.14533).
