A [Hasse diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagram) is a graphical representation of a partially ordered set (a set with a transitive, reflexive, antisymmetric ordering), where all elements are drawn as vertices and edges (directed towards the top of the page) connect pairs of vertices x and y if x < y and there is no other element z such that x < z < y.
Partially ordered sets (or _posets_ for short) appear as an abstract structure in many areas of mathematics, though Hasse diagrams are mostly useful for finite posets.

In gravitational physics, a spacetime manifold is a poset where the ordering is given by its causal structure that partially orders the spacetime points (events).
Their discrete analogous are lattices and causal sets (or _causets_ for short), which are locally finite posets, so every set of elements z between a pair of events x < z < y is finite and thus representable with a Hasse diagram.
Causal sets are the central objects in an approach to quantum gravity, where a spacetime manifold is considered to be the macroscopic counterpart to ensembles of causal sets at a microscopic level.

Below I give a brief introduction to some tools to create and type-set Hasse diagrams for posets and causal sets.

## LaTeX package: causets

The LaTeX package `causets` {% cite Minz:2020 %} provides macros to type-set Hasse diagrams of partially ordered sets (posets) and causal sets (causets), and use them in graphics.
It is available through [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/causets), but if you have a recent full LaTeX installation, then it might be already installed on your system.
For example, it is ready to use on Overleaf.
Just load the package with

```tex
\usepackage{causets}
```

The package provides three main commands to show a diagram in text and math mode.
The macros are

- `\pcauset{..,i,..}` to insert a Hasse diagram of a 2D-order using a permutation of consecutive integers,
- `\rcauset{..,i,..}{..,i/j,..}` to print a diagram based on a permutation as before (first argument) but with those links `i/j` that listed in the second argument removed,
- `\causet{..,i,..}{..,i/j,..}` to place a diagram where the vertices are arranged according to a 2D-order permutation (first argument) but the links are added only between the element pairs `i/j` given in the second argument.

For example, use

```tex
\pcauset{1,2,...,7}  % to insert a 7-chain
\pcauset{7,6,...,1}  % to insert a 7-antichain
```

The diagrams are type-set with TikZ, so that there are plenty of additional options to label, restyle, and combine the graphics with other TikZ code.
You may find more information in the [package manual via CTAN](http://mirrors.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/contrib/causets/causets.pdf) and the [package repository on GitHub](https://github.com/c-minz/LaTeX-causets).

## Online editor: PrOSET

The macros of the LaTeX package are built on integer permutations that determine the positions of the elements in the diagrams.
To find a suitable permutation for a poset diagram while getting a live preview, I have developed the 'PrOSET editor':

## Catalogue of finite posets

The following catalogue lists diagrams for all posets up to cardinality 6.
The total number of distinct partial orders on sets of n elements (corresponding to the total page number of each part of the catalogue) is recorded in the OEIS as sequence [A000112](https://oeis.org/A000112).
All diagrams in the catalogue below are generated with the LaTeX package and the symmetry properties annotated in the catalogue are defined in {% cite Minz:2024a %}.

Each file of the catalogue contains all partial orders on a given number of elements, one poset per page including the annotated properties:

- upper left `d`: dimension of the order (as primary page order, descending)
- upper centre `l`: number of layers (as secondary page order, ascending)
- upper right `e`: number of edges in the diagram (as tertiary page order, ascending)
- centre: Hasse diagram
- lower left `s`: prime symmetry (1: singleton-symmetry, 2: 2-chain-symmetry, 3: wedge-symmetry, 4: vee-symmetry, 5: 3-chain-symmetry),
  or 1-stable locally unsymmetric poset counter
- lower centre `u`: locally unsymmetric poset counter
- lower right `p`: poset counter
